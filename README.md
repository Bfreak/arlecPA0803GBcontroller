**An attempt to hack the Arlec PA0803GB standing air conditoner, and control it via an RPI pico**

Hi. I'm attempting to modify my arlec portable AC unit by placing it in another room to isolate noise and heat, and pump the cool air into another room.
In the process, I'd like to hack the unit (probably via the communication between the front panel and the main board) via UART to control via an RPI pico W in order to monitor and control it via homeassistant, or something else.

**warning**
I am a novice. all of the supplied code and information is almost certainly garbage. If you choose to use any information provided, you do so entirely at your own risk.
